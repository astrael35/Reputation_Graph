## Introduction

The `Reputation Graph` backend is a decentralized reputation management system built using Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity and The Graph protocol. The system assigns and tracks user reputation by minting and transferring NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) representing user actions and property ownership on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Smart Contract Overview

- **Reputation System Contract (ReputationSystem.sol):**
  - Manages the minting of NFTs, property listing, ownership transfer, and reputation tracking.
  - Written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

To run and deploy this backend, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) (latest version)
- [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) for smart contract development and deployment.
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- [The Graph CLI](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developer/quick-start/) for subgraph development and deployment.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/reputation_graph.git
   cd reputation_graph
   ```

2. **Install Project Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Open the Contract in Remix:**
   - Navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
   - Load `ReputationSystem.sol` to start coding or compile.

## Configuration

### Solidity Development

Ensure your Solidity environment is set up correctly. Open the `ReputationSystem.sol` file in Remix IDE for compiling and deploying to your preferred Ethereum network.

## Deploying the Smart Contract

1. **Deploy Using Remix:**
   - Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
   - Compile the `ReputationSystem.sol` contract.
   - Connect MetaMask to your preferred Ethereum network (e.g., Rinkeby, Mainnet).
   - Deploy the contract and save the contract address.

## Subgraph Development and Deployment

1. **Create a Subgraph:**
   - Use The Graph CLI to initialize a new subgraph for tracking events emitted by the `ReputationSystem` contract.

2. **Deploy the Subgraph:**
   - Deploy your subgraph to The Graph’s hosted service:
   ```bash
   graph deploy --product hosted-service <your-subgraph-name>
   ```

## Testing

- Ensure to test the contract thoroughly on the Ethereum test networks.
- Use Remix IDE’s built-in testing tools or deploy the contract on a test network to perform end-to-end tests.
